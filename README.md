# Amazonese
A brief Chrome extension to translate the names of AWS services to something useful. Based off of https://www.expeditedssl.com/aws-in-plain-english

### Usage

* Clone the repo
* In Chrome go to "chrome://extensions"
* Select 'Developer Mode' and then 'Load Unpacked Extensions'
* Select the Amazonese repo and load it
* Log into AWS and understand *everything*


Contact me if you think there's a better name for one of the AWS functions, I just copied out of the above article.
